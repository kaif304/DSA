# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! ðŸŒŸ This repository is a collection of my solutions to various DSA problems, solved in Java. It contains well-optimized code for a wide range of algorithmic problems, including arrays, strings, dynamic programming, trees, graphs, and much more.

## ðŸ“– About the Repository

This repository is aimed at maintaining all my solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms problems that I've solved during my practice on various platforms like **LeetCode, CodeChef, GeeksforGeeks**, and more using **Java**. The primary goal is to provide clean, optimized, and readable solutions that can serve as a reference for myself and anyone else interested in **DSA**.

Each solution is written in Java, following the best practices in terms of code style and algorithmic efficiency.
